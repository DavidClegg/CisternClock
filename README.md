# CisternClock
 A clock based on Cisternian Number notation

---

The Cisternian number system uses simple lines and a stem to represent digits. Unlike our common system, this grows left to right AND top to bottom as the number grows.

In this project I am treating it a little different, the hours are the top 2 digits, minutes in the middle, and seconds at the bottom.

I felt like including the code would be a fun task to add to the project. Initially I wanted to write a parser, but my ambition was larger than my stomach.
